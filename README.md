Desmos api wrapper that extends the functions of the graphing calculator

# Notes

* PLEASE DM me of any ways to make my code more readable, faster or have any feature ideas.  
* I am looking for someone to help me comment my code, as that is one thing I am working on but still very bad at.  
* Descided to use JS because, my C habits make me over complicate the TS code.  
* Empty functions are in development and to be added soon.
